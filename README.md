# BabySoundexCloud
Cloud of baby name soundex's
## Planned workflow
1. Scrape baby names, year, count and gender from [List of Baby names by year] (https://www.ssa.gov/cgi-bin/popularnames.cgi)
2. Create the soundex for each name (how?)
3. Cluster names by soundex for each year.
4. compare years and see if anything cool appears
